# Paris-Metro-Project

## Algorithm Paris Metro Lines

### Overview
The background of the study is the test of different algorithms for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. Among the algorithms used in the simulation (Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Fibonacci, Dijkstra), however, we will focus on Dijkstra's algorithm which is used by the OSPF dynamic routing protocol (where each node is A router and each link is a link).

Dijkstra's algorithm assigns a weight to each arc in the graph. The shortest path is defined by the weight of the arcs.

### Main goal:

Dijkstra's implementation is applied to the subway network of Paris, where each station is a node and the path between two stations is an arc. The purpose is therefore to find the shortest path between two different stations.

### Time Complexity Of Project Metro:
Worst Case Scenario (update in progress)
