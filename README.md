# Paris-Metro-Project

##Algorithm Paris Metro Lines

###Overview
The study context is the test of different algorithm has been made allowing to seek what is the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. Among the algorithms used during the simulation (Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, Fibonacci, Dijkstra), but we will focus on the Dijkstra algorithm which is used by the OSPF dynamic routing protocol (where each node is A router and each link a link).

The Dijkstra algorithm allows to assign to each arc of the graph a weight. The shortest path is determined by the weight of the arcs.

###The objective

The Dijkstra implementation is applied to the metro network of Paris, each station being a node and the path between two an arc. The aim is therefore to find the shortest path between two stations.
